    "content": "Penne is an esoteric programming language that imagines a world where, instead of being ostracized for leading to so-called “spaghetti code”, the humble goto statement became the dominant method of control flow, surpassing for loops and switch statements, and ultimately obviating the need for the invention of RAII and object-oriented programming in general. By applying modern sensibilities to the use of the goto statement instead of banishing it altogether, Penne seeks to bring about a rennaissance of pasta-oriented programming. ",

    "content": "Penne’s general aesthetic is inspired by modern programming languages (in particular Rust), with the notable exception of labels and the goto statement, which are (at least syntactically) taken from C, and the loop statement. // Calculate the number of Collatz steps needed to reach 1. // The Collatz conjecture states that this function always terminates. fn determine_collatz_number(start: i32) -&gt; i32 { var x = start; var steps = 0; { if x == 1 goto return; do_collatz_step(&amp;x); steps = steps + 1; loop; } return: steps } // If x is even, divide it by 2.

    "title": "Language features",
    "content": "A brief overview of the more unique language features of Penne: . goto and loop . In Penne, goto is a local forward-only jump. This is achieved by giving labels a reverse scope: similar to how variables cannot be referenced before they are declared, labels cannot be jumped to after they are declared. fn foo() -&gt; i32 { var x = 0; goto end; x = 10; // this line is not executed end: x = x + 1; return: x } . This function returns 1, not 11. The only way to jump back is with the loop block: . fn foo() -&gt; i32 { var x = 0; { x = x + 1; loop; } return: x } . Here the line x = x + 1 is executed forever and the end of the function is never reached. Views . Function arguments other than pointers (see below), primitives and words are passed as a view. For arrays this means an array view (or “slice”) is created and passed into the function. Array views remember the length of their array, which can be accessed with the length operation |x|. fn foo() { var data: [4]i32 = [1, 2, 3, 4]; var total = sum(data); } fn sum(x: []i32) -&gt; i32 { var total = 0; var i = 0; { if i == |x| goto return; total = total + x[i]; i = i + 1; loop; } return: total } . Reference pointers . Views allow you to pass a large value by reference, but they only give immutable access. For mutable access, a pointer is needed. They can be created by taking the address of a value. Unlike in most other languages, reference pointers in Penne automatically dereference to their base type, which is any type that isn’t a reference pointer. var x: i32 = 17; var a: &amp;i32 = &amp;x; var y: i32 = a; a = 30; // Now x == 30 and y == 17. To change which value a reference pointer points to, you need to explicitly modify the address. var x: i32 = 17; var y: i32 = 30; var z: i32 = 88; var a: &amp;i32 = &amp;x; &amp;a = &amp;y; // Now a points to y instead of x. var b: &amp;i32 = &amp;z; &amp;a = &amp;b; // Now a and b both point to z. Reference pointers allow a function to modify its arguments, but require the caller to explicitly pass in an address. fn foo() { var data: [4]i32 = [1, 2, 3, 4]; set_to_zero(&amp;data); } fn set_to_zero(x: &amp;[]i32) { var i = 0; { if i == |x| goto end; x[i] = 0; i = i + 1; loop; } end: } . Structs and words . Like arrays, structural types declared with the struct keyword are implicitly passed as a view and cannot be used as the return value of a function. However fixed size structures, declared with word8, word16, word32, word64 or word128, are passed by value. Imports . The import keyword is used to import all function signatures, structures and constants marked pub from a source file into the destination file. Imports are themselves not public and hence are not re-imported. Interoperability with C . Functions marked extern use the C ABI, which means it is possible (though not necessarily safe) to call them from C code compiled by LLVM. Conversely, declaring a function header such as . extern fn foo(buffer: []u8, length: usize); . allows you to call a C function from Penne code. Interacting with other programming languages that utilize or support the C ABI, such as C++, Rust, Zig or WebAssembly, is also possible. Only array views, pointers and the primitive types i8, i16, i32, i64, u8, u16, u32, u64 and usize are allowed in the signature of an extern function. Array views in extern functions correspond to (const) pointers in C, do not have a length (|x|) and must not be null. In a future version of Penne, pointers will also be assumed to be non-null and an “optional” type must be used to mark nullable pointers. Structures and constants can also be declared extern, but as of v0.3.0 this has no effect. ",
